# Icons

{% hint style="warning" %}
Icons are no longer part of our CSS for third parties. 
{% endhint %}

We encoracge you to use the same set of icons as us. Most apps will be satisfied with the free version of Font Awesome 5. For a complete overview, please refer to [https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free)

If you use the webfont solution, like us, you can paste icons like this:

```markup
<i class="fas [icon name]"></i>
```
