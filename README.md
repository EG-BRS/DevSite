# Xena Developer site

The Xena platform gives you an API along with language-specific examples, and documentation to help you develop apps that integrate with Xena.

The core functionality of Xena apps is to **enhance the Xena application by allowing developers to implment custom fetures not avaliable in the standard implmentation of Xena**. This page describes some of that functionality and points you to resources to assist you in building it into your app.
