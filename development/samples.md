# Samples

We have prepered few samples:

* [Hybrid flow in ASP.NET core app](https://github.com/EG-BRS/Identity.Server.Sample.Dotnet/tree/master/HybridMVC.Core)
* [Implicit flow in ASP.NET core app](https://github.com/EG-BRS/Identity.Server.Sample.Dotnet/tree/master/ImplicitMVC.Core)
* [Implicit flow in javascript app](https://github.com/EG-BRS/Identity.Server.Sample.Dotnet/tree/master/ImplicitJavascript)

To start these samples you will have to [create an application in Xena](get-started/createapplication.md) and [configure it](get-started/xena-api-using-oauth.md).

In the samples you will need to change [Client ID] and secret if you chose Hybrid flow. On the [Xena OAuth configuration](get-started/xena-api-using-oauth.md) page you will need to setup proper redirect uri.
