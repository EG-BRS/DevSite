# Best practices

## Code

Please refer to the other pages in the Get started section of our developer site.

## Design 

We provide all developers with our CSS and style guide to help you easily design your app or plugin to match the rest of Xena. Please refer to our [Design Guide](../user-interface/styleguide/) for a complete overview of how to style different elements.

Regarding icons, please use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=s&s=solid). Exceptions could be plugins that mimic other existing systems.

## Workflow

Have a clear flow in your app, to help the user accomplish his task. To do this, make wise use of hierarchy, tabs and/or steps.

Also, carefully consider where it makes most sense to locate your app. Does it need a menu for itself with its own views? Or just a spot in an existing menu or a tab in a view?

## Communication

Using a simple yet professional language will help the user to understand your message quickly. End users may not need to know every detail, or a full explanation. If a decision can be made with just a few facts, it may be a better solution.

Don't:

* Don't use humor or jokes in warnings or everyday tasks.
* Don't address the user by name, unless there is a good contextual reason.
* Don't invent new terms for key features. E.g. don't say "contact" when you mean "partner".

Do:

* Check your spelling.
* Ensure your texts are clear and natural.
* Stick to Xena's color scheme, especially regarding alerts and primary buttons.

## Documentation

Provide the help users might need. You can create written documentation, videos or tutorials for your app and paste a link in your app's description in the Xena App Store. Again, keep it in a clear, accurate and natural language. We recommend you provide this documentation in the languages of your primary users.
