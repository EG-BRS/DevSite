description: How you can build on Xena.

# The possibilities

You can provide two kinds of apps in Xena. They can be combined in any way.

* **Additional feature:** You build a feature that can run on its own and/or use live data from Xena without migrating them to another system. An example could be a calculator app or an app for looking up data.
* **Integration with other systems:** Here you use our API to make Xena communicate with another system that also contains data. Really, this can be everything: Webshop integrations, collaborating between two systems, or use Xena to control production equipment.

## Home of your app

We provide a wide variety of options to make your app feel like a part of Xena.

### Position

When submitting your app to our app store, you can setup how users access and see your app:

* Independent view
* Independent menu group
* Panel in existing view
* Tab in existing panel
* Part of existing menus

### Technology

We use iframes to view your app inside Xena.

Xena is available on all devices. Your app will also be available on both computer, tablet and smartphone.
