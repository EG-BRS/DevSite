# Use our stylesheet

Xena strives for a unified and simple look. This help us build a UI that is easy to use and have recognizable patterns. Because Xena is used by a wide variety of businesses we have to take backward compatibility into consideration.

Xenas layout and classes are _based_ on Bootstrap version 3.3. For icons we use Font Awesome 5 Pro. And we have our own styling as well.

If you want to reuse Xena’s look’n’feel in your plugins, you can reference a subset of our stylesheet designed for plugins:

```markup

```
