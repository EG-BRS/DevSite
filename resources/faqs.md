## What type of client should I use?

The type of client you should create in the developer console depends mostly on the type of application you are createing. If you are createing a web application in Javascript and woul like to use Client side login then you should create an implisit client. If you are createing an installed application or would like to use server sided loggin then you should use a hybrid client.

Note: Javascript should always use implicit login as it runs client sided.

## What is the quota for the Xena API?

Currently there is no max quota for the Xena api. This may change in the near future.
