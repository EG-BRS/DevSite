# QuickStarts

This document is intended for developers who want to write applications that interact with Xena. It explains basic concepts of Xena and of the API itself. It also provides an overview of the different functions that the API supports.

1. You need a Xena Account to access the Xena developer plugin, request an API credentials, and register your application.
2. Create a project in the Xena Developers and obtain authorization credentials so your application can submit API requests.
3. If your application will use any API methods that require user authorization, read the authentication guide to learn how to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization.
4. Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of the JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation\) data format. JSON is a common, language-independent data format that provides a simple text representation of arbitrary data structures. For more information, see json.org.
