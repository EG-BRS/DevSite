# Introduction

## What can you do with the Xena API?

With our API you can integrate your systems with the online accounting system Xena. We also allow for external developers to build, publish and earn money with their own apps in the Xena App Store.

Xena has multiple ways to interact with external systems:

* Build [custom plugin](development/get-started/createplugin.md) applications - UI integration
* Integrate your Xena data with other business applications with [Direct API calls](development/get-started/the-xena-api.md) â€“ request based
* [Webhook callbacks](development/get-started/using-webhooks.md) - event based integration
